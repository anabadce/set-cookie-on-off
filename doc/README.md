## Description

This tool helps setting a custom cookie ON and OFF as well as displaying if the cookie is present or not.

For developers that need to, for example, set a feature toggle with a cookie on a website, this tools allows you to avoid having to open developer tools and type the cookie manually over and over again.

Example:
You are developing a new feature in your website and want to test in the real site if it works correctly, you usually create a condition on your router or your code to show the old content if cookie is missing or the new content if the cookie is set.

With this tool you quickly and easy switch from ON and OFF feature cookies based on the cookie you define, saving time from navigating the developer tools and clearly showing if your cookie is set or not.

How it works in detail:
1. You configure the extension entering the cookie name and cookie value.
2. Now within any website, you can toggle add the cookie or remove the cookie with one simple click.
3. Also you can see if the cookie is set or not as the extension will have an ON/OFF text over it.

NOTE:
This extension doesn't collect any user information.
